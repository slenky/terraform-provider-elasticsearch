This is a terraform provider that lets you provision elasticsearch resources, compatible with v6 and v7 of elasticsearch.

We fork this project for the following items:
  - use official golang SDK to consume Elasticsearch API: https://github.com/elastic/go-elasticsearch
  - implement importer in terraform
  - migrate to terraform standalone SDK
  - add some resources

## Installation


[Download a binary](https://github.com/disaster37/terraform-provider-elasticsearch/releases), and put it in a good spot on your system. Then update your `~/.terraformrc` to refer to the binary:

```hcl
providers {
  elasticsearch = "/path/to/terraform-provider-elasticsearch"
}
```

See [the docs for more information](https://www.terraform.io/docs/plugins/basics.html).

## Usage

### Provider

The Elasticsearch provider is used to interact with the
resources supported by Elasticsearch. The provider needs
to be configured with an endpoint URL before it can be used.

***Sample:***
```tf
provider "elasticsearch" {
    urls     = "http://elastic.company.com:9200"
    username = "elastic"
    password = "changeme"
}
```
